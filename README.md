**Introduction**


-  In the realm of finance, bank loans play a pivotal role in providing individuals and businesses with the necessary capital to achieve their goals and aspirations. A bank loan is a financial arrangement where a borrower receives funds from a lending institution, typically a bank, with an obligation to repay the borrowed amount over a specified period, along with accrued interest.In this case study, we delve into the world of bank loans, exploring the intricate processes involved in loan approval, risk assessment, and decision-making. The analysis revolves around understanding the factors that influence a borrower's eligibility for a loan, the evaluation of creditworthiness, and the subsequent implications for both borrowers and lenders.

-  The primary objective of this case study is to uncover valuable insights into the loan application process, highlighting the critical variables that significantly impact the loan approval or rejection decision. By utilizing data-driven methodologies and analytical techniques, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and correlations that can assist lending institutions in making informed and prudent lending decisions.



â€¢ APPROACH:

  1. Data Cleaning and Pre-processing: This step involves removing any irrelevant or missing data from the dataset, and formatting the data so that it can be used for analysis.

  2. Feature Engineering: This step involves creating new features or variables from the existing data that can be used to better understand the movies. For example, creating a new variable that represents the budget of the movie, or creating a new variable that represents the genre of the movie.

  3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This step involves visualizing the data to understand the distribution of different variables and identify any patterns or trends in the data.

  4. Data Visualization: This step involves creating visual representations of the data, such as bar charts, line plots, and scatter plots, to help understand the data and draw insights.

  5. Conclusion and Recommendation: This step will be the final step where the data is presented in an understandable way and conclusion is made based on the analysis.

## PREVIOUS LOAN STATUS 

### CLIENT TYPE






![CLIENT](https://github.com/anishkatoch/Bank-Loan-Case-Study/assets/130006013/6900fba6-c3ba-44cf-8cc4-46a9b9db8b21)















- We can see that the Defaulters are more for previously Unused offers loan status clients, who were New.
- For previously Approved status, the New clients were more defaulted followed by Repeater.
- For previously Refused applicants, the Defaulters are more Refreshed clients.
- For previously Canceled applicants, the Defaulters are more New clients.



### GENDER

![GENDER](https://github.com/anishkatoch/Bank-Loan-Case-Study/assets/130006013/73b85cfa-d55c-4177-b131-7a1df9b9a48c)



- We see that previously Refused clients are more likely to default compared to previously Approved clients.
- Additionally, in all cases, males have a higher default rate than females.




## Insights


### A. Decisive Factors for Repayer Applicants:
1. **NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE:** Academic degree has fewer defaults.
2. **NAME_INCOME_TYPE:** Students and businessmen have no defaults.
3. **ORGANIZATION_TYPE:** Clients with Trade Type 4 and 5 and Industry Type 8 have defaulted less than 3%.
4. **AMT_INCOME_TOTAL:** Applicants with Income more than 700,000 are less likely to default.
5. **CNT_CHILDREN:** People with zero to two children tend to repay the loans.



### B. Decisive Factors for Defaulter Applicants:
1. **CODE_GENDER:** Men are at relatively higher default rates.
2. **NAME_FAMILY_STATUS:** People who have civil marriage or who are single default a lot.
3. **NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE:** People with Lower Secondary & Secondary education.
4. **NAME_INCOME_TYPE:** Clients who are either on maternity leave or unemployed default a lot.
5. **OCCUPATION_TYPE:** Avoid Low-skill Laborers, Drivers and Waiters/barmen staff, Security staff, Laborers, and Cooking staff as their default rate is significant.
6. **CNT_CHILDREN:** Clients who have children equal to or more than 9 default 100%, and hence their applications are to be rejected.
7. **AMT_GOODS_PRICE:** When the credit amount goes beyond 3 lakhs, there is an increase in defaulters.




## Suggestions:

1. **Repayment Rate of Previously Cancelled Clients:** Record reasons for cancellation to determine and negotiate terms with repaying customers in the future for increased business opportunities.

2. **Conversion of Rejected Clients to Repaying Clients:** Document reasons for rejection to mitigate business loss and approach them again for further loan offers.



## Results:

1. **Housing Type Influence on Default Rates:** Majority of loan applications are from people living in rented apartments or with parents, requiring careful credit assessment to reduce default risk.

2. **Impact of Loan Amount on Default Rates:** Clients availing loans in the 3-6 Lakhs range have a higher tendency to default, consider applying higher interest rates for this credit range.

3. **Income Level and Default Probability:** Most applications are from individuals with total income less than 3 Lakhs, who have a higher probability of defaulting. Offer loans to this income group with higher interest rates.

4. **Effect of Number of Children on Default Rates:** Clients with 4 to 8 children have a significantly higher default rate, consider imposing higher interest rates on loans for this group.

These insights can help the bank make informed decisions and improve its loan policies for better risk management and business growth.

Consequently, it becomes the agencies' responsibility to carefully evaluate and decide which loan applications to approve and which ones to reject.
- The banking sector, particularly the loan industry, is a highly successful and stable industry, generating billions in revenues and supporting the livelihoods of millions of people. Ensuring the constant stability and continuity of this specific part of the banking sector is crucial.
- The project has facilitated making tough decisions regarding dropping certain columns, changing values, and refining data, providing insights into real-life problems that can arise in the banking sector due to data unavailability.
- This project has enabled the practical application of theoretical knowledge of Excel, enhancing skills and understanding of data analysis in the context of the banking industry.
- Overall, this project has shed light on the complexities and significance of the loan approval process and data analysis in the banking sector, underscoring the importance of informed decision-making for the continued success and growth of the industry.
